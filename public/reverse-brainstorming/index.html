      <h1>Reverse Brainstorming</h1>
      <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Clearly identify the problem or challenge, and write it down.</li>
        <li>Reverse the problem or challenge by asking, "How could I possibly cause the problem?" or "How could I possibly achieve the opposite effect?"</li>
        <li>Brainstorm the reverse problem to generate reverse solution ideas. Allow the brainstorm ideas to flow freely. Do not reject anything at this stage.</li>
        <li>Once you have brainstormed all the ideas to solve the reverse problem, now reverse these into solution ideas for the original problem or challenge.</li>
        <li>Evaluate these solution ideas. Can you see a potential solution? Can you see attributes of a potential solution?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Insert example here.</p>
