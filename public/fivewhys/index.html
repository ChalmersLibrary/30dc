      <h1>Five Whys</h1>
      <p>The primary goal of using the method <strong>Five Whys</strong> is to determine the root cause of a problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question.</p>
      <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
      <p>An example of a problem: You are on your way home from work and your car stops in the middle of the road.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u>Why</u> did your car stop? – <em>Because it ran out of gas.</em></li>
        <li><u>Why</u> did it run out of gas? – <em>Because I didn’t buy any gas on my way to work.</em></li>
        <li><u>Why</u> didn’t you buy any gas this morning? – <em>Because I didn’t have any money.</em></li>
        <li><u>Why</u> didn’t you have any money? – <em>Because I lost it all last night in a poker game.</em></li>
        <li><u>Why</u> did you lose your money in last night’s poker game? – <em>Because I’m not very good at “bluffing” when I don’t have a good hand.</em></li>
      </ol>
